Managing Python dependencies in isolated environments is a common practice in software development. But what if you need a quick, temporary virtual environment that you can discard after use? Here’s a simple tool and workflow to create throw-away Python virtual environments.

---

### **The Problem**

While Python’s built-in `venv` or tools like `virtualenv` are excellent for managing environments, they require setup and cleanup. For quick experiments or isolated dependency installations, this process can feel cumbersome.

---

### **The Solution**

You can use a simple shell script to automate the creation of throw-away virtual environments.

---

### **Step 1: Create the Script**

Create a script called `tempvenv.sh`:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Create a temporary virtual environment
TEMP_VENV=$(mktemp -d)
python3 -m venv "$TEMP_VENV"

# Activate the virtual environment
source "$TEMP_VENV/bin/activate"

# Provide instructions for the user
echo "Temporary virtual environment activated."
echo "To exit, type 'deactivate'."
echo "The environment will be deleted after you exit."
